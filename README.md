Calculator using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made functions and added some simple math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. 

Mainly the functions that we need are: handling the keypresses, inputting the digits, inputting the decimal point/key, handling operators, resisting the calculators, updating the display, equal key and clear key.
